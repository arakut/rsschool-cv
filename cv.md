### About me
I'm 25 y.o. dota 2 enjoyer and now I'm constantly in a study. 
I graduated from university in 2020. After that I've worked for profession 2 years. It was civil engineering. 

Every day I try to improve my English knowledge and programming skills. 
Especially, I like to solve catas on the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/swoopi215).

I hope to became a programmer one day, but now I have to learn more, cuz nowadays requirements for Jun pos are high.
